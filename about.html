        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Citizens of the Internet is a personal website gallery that features unique, thoughtful and expertly-crafted
            personal websites from across the internet.</p>
        <p>Approximately 5.52 billion people on Planet Earth, or 69% of the global population, use the internet every day. Of these users, perhaps only 1% or less have their own personal website.</p>
        <p>This gallery is dedicated to that 1%, to the nerd necks who have staked their claim of the information superhighway and built their own hypertext home.</p>
        <p>Citizens is created and curated by <a href="https://benhatch.com" target="_blank">Ben Hatch</a>.</p>
